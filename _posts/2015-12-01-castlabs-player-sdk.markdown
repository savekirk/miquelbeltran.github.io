Development of a multiplatform modular Video
Player SDK for Android and iOS. Main features include Adaptive
Streaming playback with MPEG-DASH, HLS and Smooth Streaming, AVC(h264) and
HEVC(H265) video decoding, surround audio support with DTS and Dolby technology
and content protection with DRM using OMA and Widevine Modular.

Common components of the player were in C++ and could be used on any
platform, including Android and iOS. Platform specific parts were developed using
the platforms API and languages, which was Java for Android and Obj-C for iOS.
This project used NDK (Native Development Kit) and JNI (Java Native Interface)
for the multiplatform components in Android.

The project incorporated Google's ExoPlayer in 2015.

## Customers

The projects has milions of users worldwide though the apps of VUDU, MUBI,
Primetime and other castLabs customers.

## Roles

As the **Technical Team Lead on Mobile**, I was in charge of overseeing all the
project development and implementing key components for both Android and iOS
platforms. I managed a team of six developers on both platforms and was the
point of contact for our customers.

## Duration

The project started circa 2012 and is still under development with the name of
[PRESTOplay](http://castlabs.com/products/prestoplay-mobile/). I left the
project in 2015.
