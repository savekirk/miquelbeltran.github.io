# Hello!

I'm a **Freelance Android Developer** based in Berlin, Germany. I am skilled at
building native apps for Android.
I am not only passionate about building new things, but also at improving them,
and I can help you improve your development processes with my experience.

## My Expertise

I've been a developer since 2006, when I got my first job as a Java developer,
and **I've been working with Android since 2012** (when Android "Ice Cream Sandwich"
was the new big thing). In the past, I have also worked with embedded systems
in C, I've created games in C++, management tools in C# and iOS apps with
Objective-C. [Check my projects here.](/projects)

As a mobile developer, I've been creating apps and libraries for seven years
and I am still enjoying it, specially since Kotlin came out. As well, I've been
experimenting with Flutter, a new framework to build high-performant hybrid
applications that run both on Android and iOS.

And last but not least, **I love teaching**. [I am a public speaker](/talks) and also
[blog author](https://medium.com/@miqubel).
I have spoken at conferences worldwide and my articles have helped
thousands of developers understand complex concepts. I'd be more than happy to
help your team improve with workshops and seminars.

## My way of working

I believe that **communication is the most important skill** that developers should
have and I reflect that in my way of building things: well documented code,
easy to read and easy to maintain. I am always happy to answer questions and
collaborate, like doing pair programming even remotely.

I believe tests are first class citizens, so I treat testing as a priority too.
I like to use continuous integration and to do TDD whenever it is possible. If
you are not writing tests yet, I can help you and your team get started with
unit and UI testing for mobile.
