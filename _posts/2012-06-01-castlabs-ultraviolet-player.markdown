Development of an Ultraviolet (uvvu.com) player for Android.

Ultraviolet was a video format also known as "Common File Format", designed to
replace Blueray in the future, the project was discontinued in favour of
streaming video formats.

castLabs planned to release this app to the market but as the project was
canceled this was discontinued. Instead the project pivoted into [castLabs
Video Player SDK](http://beltran.work/castlabs-player-sdk/).

## Roles

As **Senior Developer** I was in charge of design and development of an Android
native library in C++ capable of playing Common File Format movies with the
Android OS player, with OMA DRM for rights management.

As well, I developed the app that integrated the library, directed to end-users
and distributed only via private alpha channel distribution on the Play Store.

The project team was componsed by three developers including an intern who I
mentored.
