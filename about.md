<h2>Community & Volunteering</h2>

<p>Since 2016 I am part of the Google Developers Group organizers team in
Berlin. Since then, I've been hosting workshops as part of the Women Techmakers
activities twice a month to teach Android development to beginners. Our events
have a strong focus on being inclusive and help those who did not have the
opportuniy to start a carreer in IT.</p>

a community conference with international speakers on Google technologies.</p>

<h2>Passion for coding</h2>

<p>I consider myself lucky for having a profession that is as well one of my
hobbies. I enjoy attending to tech conferences, reading and writing blog posts
and learning new things through personal projects.</p>
