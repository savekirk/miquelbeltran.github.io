Starting May 2016 I worked on the Android application for [Nebenan.de](http://nebenan.de).

Nebenan is an online platform that connects neighbours within the same neighbourhood, and it's main focus is the European market.

The Android stack includes:

- Kotlin
- RxJava version 2
- Retrofit with RxJava and GSON
- Dagger 2 for dependency injection
- Architecture Components with Room, ViewModel and LiveData
- Espresso integration tests
- JUnit unit tests

The application follows a clean architecure separating the data sources,
business model and the UI implementation.

## Roles

As the **Lead Android Engineer** I was in charge of the application
development, architecture, hiring and mentoring of new team
members.

I was the first Android developer in the company and started building the
application from scratch.
